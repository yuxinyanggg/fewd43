					<p class="descriptive-text">Through its associated firm, <strong>Magdalene Management Services Pte Ltd</strong>, we also provide services for incorporation of companies and corporate secretarial services.</p> 

					<p class="descriptive-text">The firm started off from Ms Tan's sole practice in East Coast Road and has since grown to a 10-auditor SCA (Singapore Chartered Accountant) firm with a large and diverse client base, ranging from Singapore-based trading and manufacturing companies, to law firms as well as European investment corporations.</p>

    				<h2>Our Services</h2>
    				<p>For all organisations, accounts preparation on an annual basis is essential to the effective running of their business. In the case of Companies, there is a statutory obligation to file audited accounts in a statutory format annually with ACRA. For Sole Proprietors and Partnerships, the information obtained from annual accounts preparation not only helps you measure your business performance, it also provides financial information required for the completion of personal tax returns.</p>

					<p>We not only seek to help businesses fulfill their statutory obligations, but also use the opportunity to work with the company's management team to improve their overall business performance. Monitoring the financial performance of your business is of paramount importance and regular management accounting information is vital to the continued success of your business. We can undertake the management accounting responsibility on your behalf and provide regular financial reports and advisory services to help you improve your profits or to help your business grow.</p>

					<p>Our Accounting & Audit Services include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Accounts Preparation & Statutory Filing</li>
						<li>Bookkeeping</li>
						<li>Audit</li>
						<li>Accounting Advisory</li>
